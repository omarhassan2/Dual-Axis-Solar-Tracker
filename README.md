# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker

![Solar Tracker Demo](/DUA_AXIS.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Dual-Axis Solar Tracker implemented using the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller concept. The project aims to efficiently orient solar panels towards the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy generation.

## Features

- **Dual-axis tracking:** The solar tracker adjusts both azimuth and elevation angles to precisely follow the sun's path.
- **PID Control:** Utilizes the PID control algorithm to continuously adjust the position of solar panels for optimal solar exposure.
- **User-friendly interface:** Includes intuitive controls and monitoring tools for easy interaction and performance analysis.
