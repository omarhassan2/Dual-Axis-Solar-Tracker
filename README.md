# ðŸš€Welcome to Our Dual-Axis Solar Tracker RepositoryðŸš€

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Dual-Axis Solar Tracker implemented using the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller concept. The project aims to efficiently orient solar panels towards the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy generation.

## Introduction

**Key Features:**
- **Dual-axis tracking:** Our solar tracker adjusts both azimuth and elevation angles to precisely follow the sun's path throughout the day.
- **PID Control:** Leveraging the PID control algorithm, our system continuously fine-tunes the position of solar panels for optimal solar exposure, even under changing environmental conditions.
- **User-friendly interface:** We've designed intuitive controls and monitoring tools to facilitate easy interaction and comprehensive performance analysis.
- **Additionally:** Our project incorporates a data logging system using Google Sheets to store data retrieved from Firebase. A Python script is provided to analyze the data and generate plots showcasing the power output of the solar panels throughout the day.

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker can be found in the `Schematic` directory. This diagram provides a detailed layout of the electrical connections required to build the solar tracker system.

## PID Controller

The PID Controller is a crucial part of our solar tracker system. It ensures precise control over the movement of the solar panels. The Simulink module used to obtain the PID constants (Kp, Ki, Kd).

## Visualization Data

After the system work we take the data from Google-Sheet and graph the total power generation along the day. By using Python Script to plot it.
